        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo City, Empire of
            Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born
            1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother's company,
            which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II.
            The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's
            early life. Miyazaki's father enjoyed purchasing paintings and
            demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known
            artistic understanding. He said that he was in the Imperial Japanese
            Army around 1940; after declaring to his commanding officer that he
            wished not to fight because of his wife and young child, he was
            discharged after a lecture about disloyalty. According to Miyazaki,
            his father often told him about his exploits, claiming that he
            continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki
            died on March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt that he had
            often looked at his father negatively and that he had never said
            anything "lofty or inspiring". He regretted not having a serious
            discussion with his father, and felt that he had inherited his
            "anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about embracing
            contradictions".
