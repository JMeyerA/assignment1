              <p>
                Hayao Miyazaki was born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo City,
                Empire of Japan, the second of four sons. His father, Katsuji
                Miyazaki (born 1915), was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his
                brother's company, which manufactured rudders for fighter planes
                during World War II. The business allowed his family to remain
                affluent during Miyazaki's early life. Miyazaki's father enjoyed
                purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but
                otherwise had little known artistic understanding. He said that
                he was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940; after
                declaring to his commanding officer that he wished not to fight
                because of his wife and young child, he was discharged after a
                lecture about disloyalty. According to Miyazaki, his father
                often told him about his exploits, claiming that he continued to
                attend nightclubs after turning 70. Katsuji Miyazaki died on
                March 18, 1993. After his death, Miyazaki felt that he had often
                looked at his father negatively and that he had never said
                anything "lofty or inspiring". He regretted not having a serious
                discussion with his father, and felt that he had inherited his
                "anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about embracing
                contradictions".

            If it is a dying craft we can't do anything about it. Civilisation
            moves on. Where are all the fresco painters now? Where are the
            landscape artists? What are they doing now? The world is changing. I
            have been very fortunate to be able to do the same job for 40 years.
            That's rare in any era
